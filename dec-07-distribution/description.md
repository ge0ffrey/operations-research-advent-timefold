Hi, DORothy here ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

I'm the Chief Operations Officer of OptimizeLogistics, a complex transportation and distribution company from the USA facing a critical optimization challenge.

There are a lot of products that need to be served to our clients, and multiple ways of selecting them.

We usually get several subsets of products, calculate their associated cost (at a subset of products level), and finally select those subsets that minimize our costs.

Of course, all the products must be delivered just once, meaning that a product cannot appear in two different subsets.

I'll give you an example with 135 products and all the 51975 subsets we built with a cost.

Can you help me solve this problem?
