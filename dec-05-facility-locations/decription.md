Hi, FlORence ici ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

I'm a manager of AmazOR that wants to find the best possible locations for our warehouses while deciding how to allocate our client demands to these warehouses.

Our warehouses can only handle a limited amount of demand but we need to ensure that all client demands are met.

While opening a new facility, we have some fixed costs, and we also take into account the cost of allocating the demand of each client to each warehouse.

Of course, we want to minimize our costs here...

Can you help me solve this problem?
