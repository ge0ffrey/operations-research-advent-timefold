🧠 The problem
Now it's time to deliver! 🚚

Remember all the orders we received yesterday at the warehouse?

Well... We need to deliver them.

The main problem is that we made a sub-contract for that and there's only one vehicle available... For 443 places to go! 😱

We’ve noticed that going from location A to location B might be different from going from B to A 🔄🚦.

So we need to figure out the best possible path to minimize ⏱️ delivery times.

Can you help me solve this problem? 🧩
