Hi, IsiDOra qui ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

I'm a railway operations planner in La FerrORvia Italiana.

Our railway system in Italy is one of the busiest in Europe, and efficient planning is crucial to maitaining smooth operations.

We face a logistical challenge: optimizing the assignment of maintenance resources to ensure that all critical segments of our railway network are covered.

We want to minimize the costs of such operations.

Can you help me solve this problem?
